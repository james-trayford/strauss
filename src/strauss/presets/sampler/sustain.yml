# full description
description: >-
  Sustain a sample indefinitely, achieved by holding the note on and using a loop between
  0.2 and 0.5 seconds - works well to represent Object source types that vary over an extended
  period. This works best with extended samples or instruments that don't vary much, such as
  a violin or organ. Short samples (< 1s) or those that are quick or percussive (e.g. a piano)
  can lead to a regular variation in the sound that distracts from the data sonification.
  Tweaking loop_start and loop_end can help create a smoother sound for a given sample.

# use the 'forwardback' looping mode by default, between 0.2 and 0.5 seconds for each sample
