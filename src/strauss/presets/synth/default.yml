description: >-
  Default preset for the synthesizer, using three saw wave oscillators,
  two of which are detuned slightly higher and lower respectively, with
  lower volumes. This gives a harmonically rich sound, suitable for
  filtering, with detuned unison saws removing some harshness.

    The `Synth` generator type can be used to synthesise sound using mathematically
    generated waveforms or `oscillators`. The preset can be used to modify the relative
    frequency, phase and amplitude of these oscillators.

  oscillators:
    _doc: >-
      Oscillator information. Oscillator are denoted `osc<n>`, allowing an arbitrary number
      of oscillators to be combined to make the intrtinsic tone. The `default` preset
      demontrates this using 3 sawtooth oscillators, slightly detuned from each other to
      create a 'detuned saw' sound, hence the identically structured oscillators below.
    osc1:
      form: Type of waveform used for oscillator 1, choose from ['saw', 'square', 'sine', 'tri', 'noise']
      level: Amplitude of the oscillator from 0 to 1, contolling maximum volume of the note
      detune: Change in tuning as a percentage of the input frequency
      phase: The phase of the oscillator, defined in terms of fraction of a whole cycle
    osc2:
      form: Type of waveform used for oscillator 2, choose from ['saw', 'square', 'sine', 'tri', 'noise']
      level: Amplitude of the oscillator from 0 to 1, contolling maximum volume of the note
      detune: Change in tuning as a percentage of the input frequency
      phase: The phase of the oscillator, defined in terms of fraction of a whole cycle
    osc3:
      form: Type of waveform used for oscillator 3, choose from ['saw', 'square', 'sine', 'tri', 'noise']
      level: Amplitude of the oscillator from 0 to 1, contolling maximum volume of the note
      detune: Change in tuning as a percentage of the input frequency
      phase: The phase of the oscillator, defined in terms of fraction of a whole cycle

  note_length: >-
    Numerical note length in seconds
  volume_envelope: >-
    Define the note volume envelope applied to the samples.
    A,D,S & R correspond to 'attack', 'decay', 'sustain' and 'release'.
  volume_envelope:
    _doc: >-
      Define the note volume envelope applied to the samples. _'ADSR'_ is a common parametrisation in sound synthesis,
      find out more e.g. [at this link]( https://learnmusicproduction.in/blogs/music-production-and-audio-engineering/adsr-fundamentals-in-music-everything-you-need-to-know)
    A: Attack, how long it takes for a sound to rise to 100% of the `level` after it’s triggered.
    D: Decay, how long it takes for the sounds volume to die down to the `Sustain` value after the `Attack` period.
    S: Sustain, the volume level (from 0 to 1.0) maintained after the `Decay` period, while the note is held.
    R: Release, how long the tone takes to finally die away once the note is released.
    Ac: Curvature of the attack portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates increases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear attack, increasing at a constant rate.
    Dc: Curvature of the Decay portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear decay, decreasing at a constant rate.
    Rc: Curvature of the release portion of the envelope. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear release, decreasing at a constant rate.
