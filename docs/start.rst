Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This walkthrough will take you through a clean install of the code, including optional dependencies and trying your first sonification.

Installation
************

The Strauss code can be downloaded from **GitHub** at `the repository url <https://github.com/james-trayford/strauss.git>`_.

Using :code:`git` make a copy of the STRAUSS repository via SSH,

.. code-block:: bash
  
  git clone git@github.com:james-trayford/strauss.git strauss

or HTTPS if you don't have SSH keys set up,

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/james-trayford/strauss.git strauss

throughout the documentation, I will refer to this as the **strauss repo** or **code directory**.

if you just want to use the code, STRAUSS may then be installed using pip, as

.. code-block:: bash
		
	cd strauss
	pip install .

If you want to develop the code, you can instead use

.. code-block:: bash
  
	pip install -e .

where the :code:`-e` option allows a local install, such that you can modify and run the source code on the fly without needing to reinstall each time.

Example jupyter notebooks
*************************

There are a number of example applications of Strauss in the :code:`example` subdirectory of the :code:`strauss` repo. These are in Python Notebook (:code:`.ipynb`) format for an interactive, step-by-step. They are also provided in Python script format (:code:`.py`).

In order to run the Notebook examples, first ensure that :code:`jupyter` is installed on your system. These were developed in :code:`jupyter-lab`, which can also be installed using pip, as

.. code-block:: bash
  
	pip install jupyterlab

Then, running :code:`jupyter-lab` in the :code:`strauss` should initiate the :code:`jupyter-lab` server and open a browser window. Navigate to the :code:`examples` directory within the :code:`jupyter-lab` navigation plane, from which a number of examples can be opened and run interactively.

Running some examples
*********************

From the :code:`jupyter-lab` interface, a good starting point is the :code:`SonifyingData1D.ipynb` Notebook. This demonstrates various methods of representing a single 1D dataset sonically, using a single :code:`Object`-type source representation. The code and instruction cells provide a step-by-step gude to setting up, rendering and saving a sonification with Strauss.

For a multivariate :code:`Event`-type sonification, the :code:`StarsAppearing.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step example, and demonstrates realistic stereo imaging for panoramic data. The output from this example was used in the `"Audio Universe: Tour of the Solar System" 2021 planetarium show <https://www.audiouniverse.org/education/shows/tour-of-the-solar-system>`_.

For a multivariate, multi-source example using an :code:`Object`-type source representation, see the :code:`PlanetaryOrbits.ipynb` Notebook, the output of which was also used in the "Audio Universe: Tour of the Solar System" planetarium show.

In addition to the above-mentioned examples, there are a number of other Notebooks, each representing the diverse applications and uses of the Strauss code to sonify data in different ways. A more detailed overview of the example Notebooks and scripts can be found in  :ref:`examples`.
