description: >-
  Default preset for the synthesizer, using three saw wave oscillators,
  two of which are detuned slightly higher and lower respectively, with
  lower volumes. This gives a harmonically rich sound, suitable for
  filtering, with detuned unison saws removing some harshness.

    The `Spectraliser` generator type can be used to represent a frequency spectrum, by mapping
    any frequency range to an audible range, and generating a representative sound signal (using
    an [IFFT approach](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fft.ifft.html)).
    In this approach, narrow spikes become tones at their frequency position, a sloped continuum
    becomes coloured noise, etc.

  note_length: >-
    Numerical note length
  volume_envelope: >-
    Define the note volume envelope applied to the samples.
    A,D,S & R correspond to 'attack', 'decay', 'sustain' and 'release'.
  volume_envelope:
    A: Attack
    D: Decay
    S: Sustain
    R: Release
    Ac: >-
        "Curvature" of the attack portion of a note. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates increases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear attack, increasing in volume at a constant rate.
    Dc: >-
        "Curvature" of the Decay portion of a note. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear decay, decreasing in volume at a constant rate.
    Rc: >-
        "Curvature" of the release portion of a note. Values from -1 to 1, positive indicates decreases quickly then slow,
        negative slowly then quick. a value of 0 is a linear release, decreasing in volume at a constant rate.

    level: Total amplitude level of the envelope from 0 to 1, contolling maximum volume of the note
  filter: >-
    Do we apply a frequency filter to the audio signal? This can be used to change the balance of frequencies and manipulate
    the 'timbre' of a note
  filter_type: >-
    Choose from available filter types 
  cutoff: >-
    The cut-off frequency (or 'knee') of the filter, at which frequencies are attenuated beyond.
    specified between 0 and 1 as a fraction of the audible range of notes we can hear (E0 to D#10).
