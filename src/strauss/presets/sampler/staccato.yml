description: >-
  Forces a short volume envelope on each sample, such that a note is held for 30ms and fades out over 70ms, giving 100ms
  duration for each note to sound - works well to represent rapidly varying data using an Events source type.

# Numerical note length in s or "sample" for the sample length or "none"
# to last to the end of the 
note_length: 0.03

# define the note volume envelope applied to the samples
# A,D,S & R correspond to 'attack', 'decay', 'sustain' and 'release'
volume_envelope:
  A: 0.01
  D: 0.
  S: 1.
  R: 0.07
